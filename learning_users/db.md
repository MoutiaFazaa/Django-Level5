Updating rows:


    UPDATE cities
    SET population = 39505000
    WHERE name = 'Tokyo';


Deleting rows:

    DELETE FROM cities
    WHERE name = 'Tokyo';


Plan Moving forward: working with tables

    database for a photo-sharing app, we will make other databases (users, photos, comments, likes)

    One to many AND many to one relationships
    -> if we see a one to many or a many to one relation ship, the opposite is true ( a photo has many comments OR a user has many pictures)

    many to many AND one to one relationship
